    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A chocolate cookie ice cream sandwich makes for an easy, delicious, cool treat for kids and kids at heart!
         This recipe uses cake mix for soft, moist cookies; decorate the ice cream with candies, sprinkles, 
         or whatever you like!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix</li>
      <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>½ cup butterscotch chips</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>½ gallon vanilla ice cream, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease baking sheets.</li>
      <li>Mix cake mix, butter, eggs, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and vanilla in a large bowl. 
        Roll dough into 2-inch balls and place them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake 
        for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Do not overbake; the cookies should be set, but still soft. 
        Let cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before removing to finish cooling on wire racks.</li>
      <li>Using an ice cream scoop, mold ice cream into a ball about the size of the cookies. Place scoop 
        of ice cream between two cookies and gently press together. If you like a smooth edge, run the back
         of a spoon around the edge of the ice cream sandwich. Working quickly, fill all of the cookies, 
         lay out on a baking sheet, and place in the freezer to harden. Serve when the ice cream has frozen solid.
          Sandwich cookies can be stored in a freezer bag for up to two weeks.</li>
    </ol>
